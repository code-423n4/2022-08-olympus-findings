- In `Operator.sol`, when `reserve` is a token with a fee on transfer, the actual amount that is transferred will be too little (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/549b96bcf8b97807738572605f6b1e26b33ef411/src/policies/Operator.sol#L330). Fee-on-transfer tokens are explicitly handled in `BondBaseTeller.sol` (but with a comment stating that these tokens are not supported, which makes the explicit handling a bit weird IMO. If they were supported, the issue would be medium severity in my opinion.
- In `BondBaseCDA`, it is checked that the `payoutTokenDecimals` and `quoteTokenDecimals` are between 6 and 18. While this should not be a problem in OHM itself (as the reserve token and OHM are between these two values), there are tokens with more or less decimals (Gemini Dollar, YAM v2) and the protocol could not be used with them.
- There are some TODOs that should be addressed:
	- `TreasuryCustodian.sol`: Revoking approvals for random addresses possible (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/549b96bcf8b97807738572605f6b1e26b33ef411/src/policies/TreasuryCustodian.sol#L56)
	- https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/549b96bcf8b97807738572605f6b1e26b33ef411/src/policies/Operator.sol#L657
- In `PRICE.sol`, it would make sense in my opinion to bound `numObservations` (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/549b96bcf8b97807738572605f6b1e26b33ef411/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L97), as the system can become non-functional when the value is too large (because of out of gas errors when iterating over the observations).
- When `Heart` is out of reward tokens, it still tries to transfer them, which will revert (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/549b96bcf8b97807738572605f6b1e26b33ef411/src/policies/Heart.sol#L112). This means that even people that would call `beat()` without a reward (e.g., the OHM team) cannot do so and the reward amount first needs to be set to 0 by the heart admin.
