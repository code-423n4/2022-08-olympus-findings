#### EVENT IS MISSING INDEXED FIELDS

Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields.

```solidity
src/Kernel.sol
203-208:
    event PermissionsUpdated(
        Keycode indexed keycode_,
        Policy indexed policy_,
        bytes4 funcSelector_,
        bool granted_
    );

src/modules/PRICE.sol
26:
    event NewObservation(uint256 timestamp_, uint256 price_, uint256 movingAverage_);

src/modules/RANGE.sol
20-29:
    event WallUp(bool high_, uint256 timestamp_, uint256 capacity_);
    event WallDown(bool high_, uint256 timestamp_, uint256 capacity_);
    event CushionUp(bool high_, uint256 timestamp_, uint256 capacity_);

    event PricesChanged(
        uint256 wallLowPrice_,
        uint256 cushionLowPrice_,
        uint256 cushionHighPrice_,
        uint256 wallHighPrice_
    );

src/modules/TRSRY.sol
20:
    event ApprovedForWithdrawal(address indexed policy_, ERC20 indexed token_, uint256 amount_);
27-29:    
    event DebtIncurred(ERC20 indexed token_, address indexed policy_, uint256 amount_);
    event DebtRepaid(ERC20 indexed token_, address indexed policy_, uint256 amount_);
    event DebtSet(ERC20 indexed token_, address indexed policy_, uint256 amount_);

src/policies/Governance.sol
87:
    event ProposalEndorsed(uint256 proposalId, address voter, uint256 amount);
89:
    event WalletVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool for_, uint256 userVotes);

src/policies/Operator.sol
45-50:
    event Swap(
        ERC20 indexed tokenIn_,
        ERC20 indexed tokenOut_,
        uint256 amountIn_,
        uint256 amountOut_
    );
52:
    event CushionParamsChanged(uint32 duration_, uint32 debtBuffer_, uint32 depositInterval_);
54:
    event RegenParamsChanged(uint32 wait_, uint32 threshold_, uint32 observe_);
```


#### AVOID FLOATING PRAGMAS: THE VERSION SHOULD BE LOCKED

The pragma declared across the solution is 0.8.15. Locking the pragma (for e.g. by not using ^ in pragma solidity 0.8.6) ensures that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using an older compiler version with unfixed bugs. (see [here](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103))

These 2 use `>=0.8.0`, consider changing to 0.8.15 to be the same as the others.

#### Check for proposal status before `endorseProposal()`

If a proposal is already active or expired, it does not make sense to endorse anymore, some later operations can also be skipped to save some gas.

Suggestion:

In `endorseProposal()`, add status check:
```solidity
        if (proposalHasBeenActivated[proposalId_] == true) {
            revert ProposalAlreadyActivated();
        }

        if (block.timestamp > getProposalMetadata[proposalId_].submissionTimestamp + ACTIVATION_DEADLINE) {
            revert SubmittedProposalHasExpired();
        }
```

#### `userVotes` can be 0 checked

src/policies/Governance.sol
```solidity
    function vote(bool for_) external {
        uint256 userVotes = VOTES.balanceOf(msg.sender);
```

If `userVotes` is 0, all the subsequent code can be skipped to save gas.

Suggestion:
add
```solidity
    require(userVotes != 0);
```


#### EVENTS NOT EMITTED FOR IMPORTANT STATE CHANGES

When changing state variables events are not emitted. Emitting events allows monitoring activities with off-chain monitoring tools.

src/policies/Operator.sol
```solidity
    function setBondContracts(IBondAuctioneer auctioneer_, IBondCallback callback_)
        external
        onlyRole("operator_admin")
    {
        if (address(auctioneer_) == address(0) || address(callback_) == address(0))
            revert Operator_InvalidParams();
        /// Set contracts
        auctioneer = auctioneer_;
        callback = callback_;
    }

    function toggleActive() external onlyRole("operator_admin") {
        /// Toggle active state
        active = !active;
    }
```

Suggestion:
Consider emitting events after sensitive changes take place, to facilitate tracking and notify off-chain clients following the contractâ€™s activity.


#### Some wrong oracle data feed should be looked up and fixed

Sometimes the oracle might return bad data feeds. For example a stale oracle, or in volatile market, the data might be inaccurate. 
If these data stay in the records, the moving average can be inaccurate.

Suggestion:
Add some method to change the inappropriate data, or delete outliers.
